# Main Features for Users

What extra benefit does the application user get from 
running a foreign application with Nectar, as opposed to directly 
issuing `kubectl apply -f raw.github.x` or `helm install y`?
The short answer is peace of mind. Nectar lets publishers put the 
entire infrastructure-level administration of their application on rails:

## Interactive Operations

User can run through publisher-defined sequences of interactive forms.

## Preflight Checks & System Testing

Publishers can define batteries of tests that can be trigerred 
by specific events, or run on demand.

Publishers can define logic to help users diagnose errors and 
suggest remediation.

## Manifest Variable Management

Manifest variables can be listed and inspected in one place.

Publishers can set controls around variable assignment to further 
prevent misconfigurations.
